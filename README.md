Extracellular vesicle atlas [(EVAtlas)](http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/EVAtlas/): a database for expression profiles of ncRAN in extracellular vesicles

# Overview

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived membranous surrounded vesicles originated from the endosomal system (exosomes) or shed from the plasma membrane (microvesicles: MVs). Both exosomes and MVs carry proteins, nucleic acids (mRNAs, non-coding RNAs and DNA sequences) and lipids etc. from host cells. The contents of EVs (especially the ncRNAs: miRNA and piRNA etc.) play important roles in intercellular communication and could serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and therapeutic response.

# Data collection and pre-process

Extracellular vesicle Atlas (EVAtlas) is a comprehensive database for expression profiles of 8 types of ncRNAs (miRNA, piRNA, rRNA, tRNA, scRNA, snRNA, snoRNA and pRNA) in more than 2,000 EV samples from 24 human tissues of different conditions (disease and normal). In addition, as an update of EVmiRNA database, EVAtlas provides miRNA/snoRNA/tRNA TCGA expression, miRNA targets, miRNA related drugs, miRNA regulated pathways, miRNA functions, and related publications.
