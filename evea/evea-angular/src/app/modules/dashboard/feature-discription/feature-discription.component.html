  Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by living cells include exosomes and microvesicles (MVs), which contain various molecules from
  parental cells and are potential sources for disease diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers. miRNA is the most well-studied molecule type
  in EVs because of its important functions and biomarker properties. Thus, we build the Extracellular Vesicles miRNA database (EVmiRNA) to
  collect comprehensive miRNA expression profiles in EVs. In EVmiRNA database, we analyzed 462 smRNA sequencing datasets of EVs from 17
  tissues/diseases. The miRNA expression profiles, miRNA regulated pathways, miRNA function, miRNA related drugs and publications are showed
  to support the miRNA biomarker discovery.
